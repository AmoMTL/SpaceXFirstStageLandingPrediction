# SpaceXFirstStageLandingPrediction
Obtaining historic launch data for SpaceX launches using the SpaceX API, we build a dataset to train ML models to predict if the first stage of a launch will be landed back successfully or not. 
A dash app is built using plotly to see how different mission parameters are correlated to the outcome of the mission
Multiple ML agotrithms - Logistic Regression, SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision tree are trained and the accuracies of each models are compared, enabling us to select the model that is best at predicting mission outcome
